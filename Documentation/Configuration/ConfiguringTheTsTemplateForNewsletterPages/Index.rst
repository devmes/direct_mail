Configuring the TS template for newsletter pages
------------------------------------------------

Newsletter pages are just normal pages. Their rendering is configured
by the TS template. However, take the following into consideration:

- The TS template should not contain frames.

- If you insert forms in the newsletter page, you should use the GET
  method. POST method may not transfer data to the page.
